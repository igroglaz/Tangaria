class:Warrior
help:A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most problems
help: by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
help: a magical device. Their prime stats are strength, constitution, and
help: dexterity, and they will strike more blows with melee weapons than any
help: other class. A Warrior will be excellent at fighting, shooting and
help: throwing, but bad at most other skills. A warrior has bad stealth and
help: cannot learn any spells.

class:Archer
help:An Archer can shoot a squirrel in the eye so fur would not be spoiled.
help: Very good in archery, they don't really know from which side to hold a sword;
help: they don't need one honestly. With the ability to hurl multiple arrows
help: at long distances, an Archer can inflict more damage in a single turn than
help: any other character class, including mages. However, outside of their
help: powerful bow, Archers are relatively weak compared to the other classes.
help: They don't have any healing nor defensive spells like the magical 
help: classes to compensate. Archers especially like bows; shooting with them, 
help: they could achieve incredible speed and precision; much better than with 
help: a crossbow or a sling. Some Archers in time can learn how to coat their
help: arrows with poison or use sharper tips to cut deeper.|
help:Also they can see farther than others.

class:Monk
help:Monks are very different from all other classes. Monks are warriors who
help: decide to fight barehanded and cannot use weapons or bows. However, their
help: training in martial arts makes them much more powerful with no armour
help: nor weapons. As they advance in levels, they gain new martial arts
help: techniques to hit their opponents more effectively.
help: Monk abilities by level:|
help:- Level 10: fall like a feather.|
help:- Level 15: resistance to fear.|
help:- Level 20: resistance to confusion.|
help:- Level 25: resistance to paralysis.|
help:In time, a monk can learn how to stun and slow his opponents.
help: They can't wield weapons, but
help: get extra damage, defense and attacks per round as they advance. However,
help: they must wear light armor to stay unencumbered and fully benefit from
help: their class bonuses. Monks don't use mana at all, but it is rumoured that
help: the monastic training even makes monks faster than any other character
help: class! Also they can throw objects with surprising accuracy.

class:Mage
help:A Mage relies on their wits to survive. They cannot hope to simply hack
help: their way through the dungeon, and so must therefore use their magic to
help: defeat, deceive, confuse, and escape. A mage is not really complete without
help: an assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his spells. They can
help: master the higher level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and
help: have excellent saving throws to resist effects of spells cast at them.
help: However, they are incredibly weak, getting few hit dice and suffering strong
help: penalties to strength and constitution. Intelligence is their primary stat
help: and at high levels they can cast many spells without a chance of failure.
help: There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells
help: are their true realm, and they will get fewer blows with melee weapons than
help: other classes.|
help:Their spells cover a wide range - from simple detection and teleportation
help: to powerful elemental blasts and protective wards, but their favorite is
help: the Fireball spell, which they use especially well. They are also skilled
help: at making some of their spells pierce through multiple enemies in a line.|
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Shaman
help:A Shaman is a lover of nature, and at one with the natural world. Shamans
help: have control of their environment and direct power over creatures, leading
help: even to the ability to take their forms. As they grow stronger, they can 
help: transform into mightier beasts, from bears to mythical creatures.|
help:Shaman skills are moderate, and they have some fighting ability, especially
help: when transformed. A shaman will usually seek to shape the flow of events
help: to their purpose rather than using devices or missiles, but at high levels
help: they do gain access to potent nature-based magic. They call upon the raw
help: forces of nature, conjuring storms, quakes, and poison clouds. Shamans can
help: calm, slow, or drive away their foes, bending even the wildest beasts to 
help: their will. They harness the healing power of the wild, restoring health
help: and vitality when needed. Their magic shapes the land itself - raising
help: trees, splitting stone, and shaking the earth beneath their feet. Their
help: senses stretch far beyond the eye, revealing life, hidden paths, and 
help: forgotten lore. Shamans rely on their wisdom, and have good saving throws.|
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Priest
help:A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the dungeon only
help: to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to
help: fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their temple!
help: Priests receive their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose
help: which spells they will learn. A priest's prayers heal and protect, but
help: can also bring ruin to the wicked. They are especially strong against
help: evil beings, standing firm with divine power. Over time, priests gain
help: ways to shield themselves, support allies, and even reshape the world
help: around them.|
help:They are familiar with magical devices, preferring to call them
help: "instruments of God", but are not as good as a mage in their use.
help: Priests have great saving throws, and make passable fighters, better
help: if they can find a blessed weapon. Wisdom is the priest's primary stat
help: and at high enough levels they can cast many prayers without a chance
help: of failure. Priests have poor stealth.|
help:Although weak in the beginning, priests can become decent fighters 
help: who strongly prefer blunt weapons over edged ones; if they wield one that
help: isn't blessed, they receive an additional severe penalty.|
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Warlock
help:A Warlock must live by his wits. He cannot hope to simply hack his way
help: through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat,
help: deceive, confuse, and escape. |
help:A Warlock seeks to master the spirits of sentient creatures, creating
help: servants of their own will. They have chosen a dark and wicked path, and
help: run a continual risk of harm to their own body and mind. Warlocks love
help: shadows and hate light, automatically shrouding themselves in darkness.
help: They summon, command, and banish spirits, blurring the boundary between
help: life and death. With time, they transcend mortal flesh, embracing darker
help: forms...|
help:Their spells require high intelligence and frequently harm the caster or
help: place them in danger. In return, they achieve awesome power at high levels.
help: The ultimate aim of the warlock is to supplant the Dark Enemy and set
help: up a tyranny in his place.|
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Paladin
help:A Paladin is a holy warrior. Paladins are very good fighters, second
help: only to the warrior class, but not very good at missile weapons. 
help: In close combat, they can strike with their shield to disrupt
help: foes. Paladins combine martial prowess with divine prayers. 
help: They stand as champions against evil, smiting dark forces and shielding
help: themselves with holy power. Though their magic comes slowly, it grants
help: healing, protection, and strength in battle. Over time, they can bless
help: their weapons and armor, see hidden threats, and find their way through
help: darkness. They receive prayers at a slower pace than the priest, but can
help: use all but the most powerful prayers.|
help:Paladins have poor stealth, perception, searching, and magical device use.
help: They have a decent saving throw due to their divine alliance. Their
help: primary stats are strength and wisdom. Their presence commands respect,
help: though it varies among individuals.

class:Rogue
help:A Rogue is a character who prefers to live by their cunning. They blend
help: agility, stealth, and a touch of magic to survive.
help: A rogue capable of fighting their way out of a tight spot.
help: The master of traps and has high stealth enabling sneaking around many
help: creatures without having to fight, or sneak up and get the first blow.
help: They can steal items from monsters, but need to be wary of being caught
help: in the act. Rogues' perception is higher than any other class, and
help: many times they will notice a trap or secret door before having to search.
help: A rogue is better than the more fighting oriented classes with magical
help: devices, but still cannot rely on their performance.|
help:Rogues' spells are not the powerful offensive spells mages can use,
help: and there will always be a chance of failure even with the simplest
help: of them until they reach higher intelligence.
help: They use poisons, traps, and darkness to gain the upper hand, slipping
help: away when danger strikes. Their magic helps them navigate, evade, and
help: control the battlefield - just don't ask them to carry your loot.
help: They'll probably "lose" it on the way. |
help:They gain experience a bit faster than others.

class:Ranger
help:A Ranger is at home in nature, and good at turning the environment to
help: good use. Rangers balance melee prowess with deadly marksmanship,
help: and one of the best of all the classes with missile weapons, especially
help: bows.|
help:Rangers are deeply attuned to nature, drawing strength and resilience from
help: the wild. Forest magic keeps them going long after others would fall.
help: Their connection to the land grants them powerful survival abilities -
help: they can cure themselves with herbs, resist poisons, and never suffer
help: from hunger.
help: They excel at detection and navigation, able to sense nearby life and
help: uncover hidden areas.|
help:They blend archery and magic, and their arrows strike with deadly
help: precision, often enhanced by nature's power. In battle, Rangers
help: can become swift and relentless, while their tactical skills allow
help: them to shape the environment and stay one step ahead of their foes.|
help:A Ranger has solid stealth, sharp perception, a knack for searching,
help: strong saving throws, and handles magical devices better than most.
help: Their primary stats are strength, wisdom and dexterity.

class:Blackguard
help:A Blackguard is a brawler of no principle, who lives for the joy of maiming
help: and killing. Blackguards prefer heavy weapons and shields, and learn a few
help: spells for the purpose of wreaking more destruction. 
help:They charge into battle, striking with brutal force, stunning, and
help: scattering foes. They regenerate through sheer rage, strike faster,
help: and crush foes with shield blows. Masters of fear, they taunt and break
help: enemy spirits, while bolstering their own with demonic resilience.
help: With time, they can embrace their inner beast, taking the form of a werewolf
help: to wreak even greater havoc. They can summon dark minions, unleash 
help: earthquakes, and even take flight when the battle demands.
help: Their lust for blood is legendary, with a blackguard in full cry
help: nigh on impossible to kill.|
help:Blackguards scorn skills apart from slaughter, and require strength and
help: intelligence (or rat-cunning) to thrive in the dungeon.

class:Sorceror
help:Sorcerers use intelligence primarily, determining how much mana they have to
help: cast spells and how low their failure rate is. They are the greatest
help: wielders of arcane power. Their spells range from simple missiles and
help: beams to storms of mana, tidal waves, and chaotic blasts that tear through
help: entire areas. They control the battlefield - teleporting, reshaping
help: terrain, sealing spaces with runes while defending themselves with mana
help: shields and wraithform. Their unmatched mana reserves and telepathic
help: abilities make them supreme strategists in the dungeon.|
help:Though a high-level Sorcerer can be very powerful, getting there can be
help: a difficult journey. On the downside, they are the worst fighters, being
help: unable to use any weapon but a Mage Staff comfortably, and still unable
help: to be anything even remotely approaching effective with it.
help: A Sorceror has very few hit points compared to other classes, making
help: survival difficult in the beginning. That's why this class is
help: not recommended for beginners. Intelligence is the Sorceror's primary stat.|
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Unbeliever
help:The full opposite of Sorcerors, Unbelievers so strongly despise magic that
help: not only do they refuse to use magic spells, they refuse all training in the
help: use of magic items, which leaves them totally incompetent when trying
help: to use a magic item, although they can still quaff potions and read scrolls.
help: Their disbelief grants them an anti-magic aura, making magic fizzle nearby.
help: Unbelievers can prevent magical gates from opening around them, eventually
help: extending to a complete suppression of teleportation abilities and all
help: magic in the surrounding area. Unbelievers can replenish their forces
help: when fighting unnatural magic users. Also they can sense invisible
help: creatures in melee range and cancel some other magic effects, e.g. when
help: they drink from magic fountains, they often unmagic it. Their sheer will
help: lets them resist most curses, though they can't lift them.

class:Hunter
help:Hunters aren't good at fighting, but can shoot and throw faster than others,
help: landing multiple hits quickly. They can die quickly too, however. 
help: Hunters are to arrows what Warriors are to melee. They are the best around
help: with any bow, crossbow or sling. 
help: They can use wide-range of tricks, traps and even magic
help: in their hunt in the dungeons. Hunters wield elemental magic to empower
help: their shots with fire, frost, lightning, acid, poison, and even sound.
help: Their missiles can explode, confuse enemies, pierce armor or combine
help: the forces of nature in a single deadly strike.
help: They sense living creatures nearby, map surroundings,
help: extend their vision, resist poison, cure ailments, and never starve
help: thanks to their unique survival skills.|
help:Hunter is very bad at melee, being only better than the old saggy sorcerers.
help: Wisdom and dexterity are the hunter's primary stats.|

class:Telepath
help:The Telepath is a hero who uses the powers of mind instead of magic;
help: mindcrafters, they can weaken or even kill with their wits.
help: Their powers vary from simple extrasensory powers to mental
help: domination of others.|
help:Telepaths wield mental blasts, crush minds, confuse and stun their foes.
help: They sense monsters, read thoughts, map surroundings and 
help: can reveal hidden objects. Their minds can control light, heal their
help: bodies, and resist many dangers. With telekinesis, they move objects and
help: displace enemies from afar. They shield themselves with force fields and
help: resist poison, elements and time. Advanced Telepaths can manipulate
help: probability, travel through space-time, and unleash devastating waves
help: of pure mental force. Telepaths channel their powers in steady beams,
help: never missing their mark. And their minds are shielded from amnesia and
help: memory loss. They use the Wisdom score to determine how 
help: well they can perform these psychic powers. |
help:In solo combat, a Telepath is slightly weaker than a Priest, although
help: a Telepath is never penalized for wielding an edged weapon
help: (unlike a Priest).

class:Elementalist
help:Elementalists wield the four elements – Air, Fire, Earth, Water – bending
help: them to their will. They share the bloodline of Mages, but walk a rougher
help: path, caring little for support spells and focusing instead on raw
help: destruction. Walls crumble, storms rage and flood the halls, the stone
help: beneath their feet shifts and turns to mud. Their weapons crackle with
help: elemental power, their bodies shielded from harm by flame, frost, acid
help: and shock. Surges dance at their fingertips, unleashed in bolts, balls,
help: waves and storms. Their elemental spells can form beams, hitting
help: everything in their path. As masters of the elements, they gain intrinsic
help: resistances as they grow: fire at 10, cold at 15, acid at 20,
help: lightning at 25. |
help:Each time they level up, they can sharpen their craft by studying the
help: same spells again, making each one stronger and more potent.|
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Summoner
help:A Summoner begins their journey frail and defenseless, with little
help: skill in combat and only a handful of minor spells to strike at foes.
help: Yet, their true strength lies elsewhere. With a whispered word or a
help: secret gesture, they call forth creatures who fight in their stead.
help: Though the Summoner keeps a safe distance, the victories of their
help: companions still nourish their growth.|
help:Summoners know countless summoning rites: from jelly and vortex to hydra.
help: They charm their minions, extend their lifespan, or even make them
help: explode. Their magic isn't only about summoning. They can light up the
help: darkest corners, sense lurking evil, heal their wounds, or open 
help: a portal to step away from trouble. They shield themselves and grow
help: stronger. Their thunderstorms bursts outward, and when needed, they can
help: banish foes. Summoners prevent other creatures from calling reinforcements
help: too. Some spells don't even drain mana, like calling a swarm of angry bees.
help: Summoners use wisdom to cast spells and summon allies, and to determine
help: how many they can control and how well they can command them.
help: They are naturally charismatic, which helps them in spellcasting too.
help: They favor clean, blessed weapons when they must wield one.|
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Shapechanger
help:Shapechangers possess the ability to transform into various creatures by 
help: defeating them in battle. They are fighters that gain abilities from the forms
help: they can mimic. Basically, Shapechangers will melee a lot, benefiting
help: from their current form (resists, melee brands, defense, speed, damage 
help: boosts). Some of these forms provide innate spells - from simple
help: strikes to storms, from healing touches to dark summons... and even breath 
help: attacks! Some forms whisper of powers that control, others of those that
help: destroy. |
help:Shapechangers get basic mana points to cast these spells*. 
help: The higher the level of the monster, the more of these
help: creatures the Shapechanger is required to vanquish before they can assume
help: their form. While transformed, they lose their intrinsic abilities and
help: gain those of the creature they have transformed into, plus whatever
help: abilities and resistances are provided by their equipment. |
help:Outside of battle, Shapechangers rarely win hearts - their presence is
help: unsettling, something not quite human lingering beneath the surface. |
help: *Some breath attacks, like for the Dragon race, don't cost mana but
help: hit points instead. Also, some races that have their own polymorph or
help: shape forms have certain restrictions on being Shapechangers.

class:Tamer
help:Scar-covered hands of a tamer - a person who devoted his life and (remaining)
help: limbs to care for wild creatures - tell you everything about how tedious
help: and dangerous this path is. Dense thickets, burning sands, treacherous
help: mountains - you'll go anywhere to find a dragon in its den... and make
help: friends with it. That is your life's ambition.|
help:A tamer's body is fragile, but their companion stands between them and
help: danger. Their strength lies in the bond they share with their beasts.
help: Each beast you befriend teaches you something - a new way to fight,
help: to heal, or to endure. A frog's leap through poison clouds, the sharp
help: eye of a falcon, the calming warmth of a bear - all become part of you. |
help:But tamers rely not only on their furry friends. They know a few tricks
help: themselves - how to vanish in a blink, walk unseen, or even command
help: the wilds to part.|
help:It's not brute strength that tames a beast, but patience, wisdom, and a
help: touch of charm. Animals feel it. They trust you. Sometimes. And with 
help: time, maybe even the dragons will.

class:Druid
help:Druids are wanderers of the wild, attuned to the presence of nearby animals
help: and even able to shift into their forms. Skilled in martial arts and
help: avoiding weapons, they also wield nature magic.
help: Every 5 levels can learn a new animal form to transform; some
help: forms have innate abilities (to use them, press 'y' key).
help: Druid has to find spellbooks in the dungeons; such books are not for sale. |
help:Druid forms:|
help:- BIRD: fast and able to fly over water and other terrain; can heal ('y').
help: Fragile and worthless in combat, but can dodge melee attacks well.
help: Resistant to gravity. |
help:- RAT: harmless and stealthy, rats can find little cracks and holes in the
help: walls to pass through them. They can avoid traps most of the time and able to
help: sniff items to detect curses on them. Resistant to poison and can life drain. |
help:- BOAR: find different edible plants which reduce its nourishment consumption;
help: good in mushroom's identification. Boars are very wise, have high vitality
help: and fearless. Can charge at its enemies from distance ('y'). |
help:- CAT: stealthy and nimble. Can backstab sleeping target.
help: Regenerate especially fast, but bad at mana restoring. |
help:- WOLF: makes fast vicious attacks; can howl to summon allies ('y').
help: Less resistant to magic, except dark arts. Reckless in defense,
help: but generates rage while in combat. |
help:- BEAR: tough and powerful, but very noisy and a bit clumsy.
help: Can survive even very harsh blows and curses. Can bash enemies and stun them. |
help:Druids' hitpoints does not influenced by its forms and they cannot cast spells
help: while in animal form, bad at trap disarming and magical devices.|
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Fighter
help:Mercenary who uses different fighting tricks and blows to survive at all
help: costs.
help: They fight dirty if needed, but rely on skill and instinct more than brute
help: force: they dodge, strike back, roll aside, and hit where it hurts the most.
help: Known for their reckless attacks and sudden retreats, fighters balance
help: between luck, experience, and survival instinct. Between fights, they patch
help: themselves up - no wizardry, just rough hands and grit. And as seasoned
help: warriors, they value every calm moment and can take a nap here and there,
help: which helps restore their strengths even after nasty moments.|
help: Fighters can sense hidden weapon properties better than others and may
help: identify cursed gear without using magical means.
help: Their focus ("mana" pool) depends on their strength and intelligence
help: combined. |
help: Fighters are very superstitious and believe in fortune.
help: As they care a lot about signs and omens, they may get lucky to survive
help: blows that would be mortal wounds for anyone else.

class:Knight
help:Noble knight in heavy armour who charges into enemies with immense power.
help: They cannot be confused and can use their shield with astonishing mastery.|
help:They can change stances: balanced, defensive, and offensive - switching
help: tactics depending on the situation.|
help:Balanced stance steadies the mind, removing confusion.|
help:Defensive stance toughens them up, shrugging off stunning blows.|
help:Offensive stance fuels their courage, pushing away fear.|
help:Knights are resilient and disciplined, but lack stealth and magical
help: finesse. They excel in melee combat and can handle crossbows when needed,
help: turning raw strength and endurance into their greatest advantage.|
help:Their code of honour forbids them from attacking unaware enemies - 
help: they always hail before the fight.

class:Traveller
help:"Jack of all trades, master of none..."
help:A common soul who knows a bit of magic and isn't too bad with a weapon..
help: He never walks alone - there's always a four-legged friend by his side.
help: Travellers are sure they know everything about maps, directions and 
help: cardinal points... but their overconfidence often leads to real trouble.
help: They set out with a handful of useful items, just in case.
help: Seasoned travellers are no strangers to fear; they can teleport, patch
help: themselves up, or conjure a snack when hunger bites. They kindle bonfires
help: to ward off beasts, sketch maps when lost, sense nearby evil, and hurl
help: bolts of fire when words fail. They know how to bless themselves before
help: a fight, stumble upon hidden paths between levels, blink away from danger,
help: and never forget the value of a well-placed glyph.
help: 
help: p.s.
help: "..though oftentimes better than master of one".|
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Bard
help:Expert in musicianship and singing, you can not only give joy to people,
help: but also know how to use music magic to bring cure and wreak havoc.
help: Bards weave magic into their music - from soothing tunes that mend wounds
help: to thundering chords that shatter walls. Their voice can calm foes or drive
help: them into confusion. When danger rises, they call upon ancient hymns to
help: shield themselves or raise a glyph of protection. Some songs grant speed,
help: some courage, and a few strike like a storm.|
help:Bards are naturally charismatic, charming crowds with ease. Though quite
help: slender, they're surprisingly nimble and quick on their feet.|
help: They are resistant to sound attacks.

class:Battlemage
help:Battlemages specialize in destroying enemies not only with the power of
help: the elements, but also with skillful melee combat - making them a
help: universal death machine. There's no reason a Battlemage can't become a
help: good fighter, but magic is their true realm.|
help:Their spells rarely fail, and their magic bends toward battle - layering
help: resistances, hurling lightning and ice, or pulling the earth itself apart.
help: From a spark to a storm, from a stone to a black hole - their arsenal
help: leaves little untouched when they teleport through the fray, strike from
help: unexpected angles, and wield heavy weapons with brutal efficiency. When
help: wounded, they know how to patch themselves up and keep going.|
help:Unlike other magic users, Battlemages have no trouble wielding ranged
help: weapons or throwing things.

class:Necromancer
help:Weak and fragile, necromancers wield the power to raise and command armies
help: of the dead - fallen foes rise again at their side. Resistant to nether,
help: they weaken minds, drain life, and summon bone and poison to their advantage.
help: The most powerful necromancers even bind golems to their will.
help: Withered in body and distant in spirit, they rely on intellect and the
help: loyalty of the dead to keep them standing. Their spells rarely fail.
help: With each level, their sight into the darkness sharpens - they see farther
help: where others are blind.
help: Though poor in melee, they siphon a touch of life from living foes - a hint
help: of traumaturgy. And while they are not skilled fighters, they know how to
help: dig (graves... a professional touch).|
help:They are clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Hermit
help:Once frail and burdened by sickness, the hermit turned to the path of light.
help: His body never fully recovered, but his spirit grew unbreakable. A holy monk
help: sworn never to wield a weapon - though his vow doesn't stop him from crushing
help: skulls with bare hands.|
help:Hermits fight through martial arts and channel sacred light to heal, protect,
help: and strike down evil. Their magic pierces darkness, burns the wicked, and
help: shields from harm. They know secret rituals to bless the ground beneath them
help: or craft sacred water when needed.
help: During their quiet, humble ways, hermits become stealthier as wind during
help: their training. Their wisdom isn't worn on their sleeve, but it lingers in
help: every step and settles in every strike.|
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Wizard
help:A legendary magician, keeper of ancient secrets long forgotten by the world.
help: Their magic isn't about simple fireballs - it warps the fabric of reality
help: itself. A wizard snaps fingers, and the air ripples, twisting enemies into
help: something else entirely - feeding on the chaotic energy left behind.
help: They twist space to blink away, then pull it taut to tear open new paths.
help: Their power distorts the world - sparks jump where none should, frost
help: whispers in circles, and unseen hands shape the fight.
help: When needed, they call the void - unleashing storms that break the ground
help: or tearing the sky to rain down raw magic. Some whisper they've bargained
help: with daemons, but no one dares ask twice. |
help:Yet wielding such forces comes at a price: their body wears thin against
help: the chaos they summon. Minds burning bright with arcane fire, they grow
help: grumpy, subtle, and quick to anger. Some say they balance on the creeping
help: edge of madness. |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.

class:Trader
help:An enterprising merchant who went into the dungeon to fulfill his life
help: ambition: get enough money to open his own tavern.
help: Traders aren't fighters, but they know the value of a good bargain.
help: As members of the Traders Guild, they can sell items to NPC stores - 
help: something others can't do, since the authorities have declared all dungeon
help: loot "cursed". A rookie trader drives a hard bargain... badly. But with
help: experience, they learn to get better deals. |
help:Traders aren't just merchants. They know how to patch armor, sharpen blades,
help: and recharge magical devices - all for the right price.
help: They sense hidden treasures and forgotten paths, guiding their steps.
help: When words fail, they call upon old rituals, asking the gods for a little
help: luck or a bit of chaos. Sometimes both.
help: Their magic isn't flashy, but it keeps them alive - a light in the dark,
help: a potion when needed, a way to carve through stone walls.
help: And when all else fails, they know a trick or two to slip away unnoticed,
help: or send in a decoy to haggle while they make their escape. |
help:Trader proud of his cat, who follows him during adventures. Always nearby,
help: watching, judging, perhaps luckier than he is. |

help: They can chop wood and mine ore more easily as they advance in levels.|
help:In dire moments, when hunger tightens its grip, a Villager may search
help: through farmers' fields in the suburbs - once rich with harvest, now empty
