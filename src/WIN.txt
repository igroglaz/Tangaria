How to build all libraries required to run the WIN client:

- Download and unzip ZLIB 1.2.11 in the same root directory as your \Tangaria-dev folder:
	http://zlib.net
- Download and unzip LIBPNG 1.6.37 in the same root directory as your \Tangaria-dev folder:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files
- Replace the pngwrite.c file by the one from the \Tangaria-dev\src\fix folder to fix a linker error
- Find ZLIB_DIR in lpng1637\scripts\makefile.bc32 and set ZLIB_DIR=..\zlib-1.2.11 instead
- Run \Tangaria-dev\src\WIN.bat
